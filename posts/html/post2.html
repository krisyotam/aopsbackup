    <h1>Introduction to Algebraic Geometry</h1>
    <div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this post, we&#39;ll delve into the world of algebraic geometry, a fascinating field that blends algebra, geometry, and number theory. </p>
<h3>What is Algebraic Geometry?</h3>
<p>Algebraic geometry studies the solutions of systems of polynomial equations. The geometric objects defined by these equations are called varieties. Some well-known examples include <strong>elliptic curves</strong> and <strong>projective spaces</strong>.</p>
<h3>A Simple Example: Conic Sections</h3>
<p>A classic example in algebraic geometry is the study of conic sections, the curves obtained by intersecting a cone with a plane. These include circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas.</p>
<h3>Math Example: Elliptic Curves</h3>
<p>Elliptic curves are important in both number theory and cryptography. An elliptic curve can be defined by an equation of the form:</p>
<p>$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
$$</p>
<p>Elliptic curves have many applications in number theory, including proving <strong>Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem</strong>.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Algebraic geometry is a rich and deep field, with connections to many other areas of mathematics. There is much more to explore, so stay tuned for future posts!</p>
