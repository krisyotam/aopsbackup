    <h1>Exploring Complex Analysis</h1>
    <div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Complex analysis is the study of complex-valued functions, and it has powerful applications in many fields of mathematics. In this post, we will explore some basic concepts.</p>
<h3>What is Complex Analysis?</h3>
<p>Complex analysis deals with functions of a complex variable. The primary focus is on the properties of functions that are analytic, meaning they can be represented by power series.</p>
<h3>The Cauchy-Riemann Equations</h3>
<p>For a function (f(z) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y)) to be analytic, it must satisfy the <strong>Cauchy-Riemann equations</strong>:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
$$</p>
<p>These equations provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a function to be differentiable in the complex plane.</p>
<h3>Math Example: The Integral of a Complex Function</h3>
<p>One of the most famous results in complex analysis is <strong>Cauchy&#39;s Integral Theorem</strong>, which states that the integral of an analytic function over a closed curve is zero.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Complex analysis is an essential topic for anyone interested in deeper areas of mathematics, especially for its applications in physics and engineering. Stay tuned for more advanced discussions.</p>
