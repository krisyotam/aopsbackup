    <h1>The Fundamentals of Real Analysis</h1>
    <div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Real analysis is the branch of mathematics that deals with the behavior of real numbers and the functions that define them. In this post, we&#39;ll discuss some core concepts and theorems.</p>
<h3>What is Real Analysis?</h3>
<p>Real analysis focuses on the limits, continuity, and differentiability of functions. It also looks at sequences and series of real numbers, providing the foundational tools for calculus.</p>
<h3>A Core Theorem: The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem</h3>
<p>This theorem states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence. This is a fundamental result in the study of sequences and limits.</p>
<h3>Math Example: The Squeeze Theorem</h3>
<p>The Squeeze Theorem helps us evaluate limits of functions that are squeezed between two other functions. If:</p>
<p>$$
f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)
$$</p>
<p>and the limits of (f(x)) and (h(x)) are equal, then the limit of (g(x)) is also equal to that value.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Real analysis is a crucial area of mathematics that builds the groundwork for many more advanced topics. We will explore more in future posts.</p>
