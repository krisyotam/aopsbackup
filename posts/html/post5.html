    <h1>Differential Equations in Mathematics</h1>
    <div><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Differential equations are a fundamental tool in mathematics used to describe phenomena that involve rates of change. In this post, we&#39;ll introduce key concepts.</p>
<h3>What is a Differential Equation?</h3>
<p>A differential equation involves an unknown function and its derivatives. The goal is to find the function that satisfies the equation.</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Theorem of Ordinary Differential Equations</h3>
<p>This theorem states that, under certain conditions, a unique solution exists for an ordinary differential equation (ODE) given initial conditions.</p>
<h3>Math Example: Solving a Simple ODE</h3>
<p>Consider the simple first-order linear ODE:</p>
<p>$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y
$$</p>
<p>The solution to this equation is (y = Ce^x), where (C) is a constant determined by initial conditions.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Differential equations are indispensable in modeling real-world problems in physics, biology, and economics. We will explore more advanced methods and solutions in future posts.</p>
