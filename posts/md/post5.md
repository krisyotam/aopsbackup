## Introduction

Differential equations are a fundamental tool in mathematics used to describe phenomena that involve rates of change. In this post, we'll introduce key concepts.

### What is a Differential Equation?

A differential equation involves an unknown function and its derivatives. The goal is to find the function that satisfies the equation.

### The Fundamental Theorem of Ordinary Differential Equations

This theorem states that, under certain conditions, a unique solution exists for an ordinary differential equation (ODE) given initial conditions.

### Math Example: Solving a Simple ODE

Consider the simple first-order linear ODE:

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} = y
$$

The solution to this equation is \(y = Ce^x\), where \(C\) is a constant determined by initial conditions.

### Conclusion

Differential equations are indispensable in modeling real-world problems in physics, biology, and economics. We will explore more advanced methods and solutions in future posts.
