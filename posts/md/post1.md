## Introduction

Welcome to my math blog! In this post, we'll explore some fundamental concepts in number theory and solve a few interesting problems. 

### What is Number Theory?

Number theory is a branch of pure mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of numbers, particularly integers. Some famous theorems in number theory include **Fermat's Last Theorem**, **the Goldbach conjecture**, and the **Prime Number Theorem**.

### An Example of a Simple Theorem

One of the most well-known theorems is **the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**, which states that every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be factorized as a product of prime numbers. For example:

$$
12 = 2^2 \times 3
$$

This factorization is unique, which is the key feature of prime factorization.

### Math Example: Pythagorean Theorem

One of the most important results in geometry is the **Pythagorean Theorem**, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse \(c\) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides \(a\) and \(b\). Mathematically, we can express this as:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

For example, if we have a triangle with sides 3 and 4, the hypotenuse \(c\) will be:

$$
c = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{9 + 16} = \sqrt{25} = 5
$$

Thus, the sides of the triangle are 3, 4, and 5.

### Prime Numbers and the Sieve of Eratosthenes

Prime numbers are numbers that are divisible only by 1 and themselves. Some of the first prime numbers are:

$$
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, \dots
$$

One way to find prime numbers up to a given limit is by using the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**. The algorithm works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime starting from 2.

### Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed this introduction to number theory! This post is just the beginningâ€”there are so many more fascinating theorems and problems to explore in this beautiful field of mathematics.
