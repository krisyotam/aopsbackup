## Introduction

Real analysis is the branch of mathematics that deals with the behavior of real numbers and the functions that define them. In this post, we'll discuss some core concepts and theorems.

### What is Real Analysis?

Real analysis focuses on the limits, continuity, and differentiability of functions. It also looks at sequences and series of real numbers, providing the foundational tools for calculus.

### A Core Theorem: The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem

This theorem states that every bounded sequence of real numbers has a convergent subsequence. This is a fundamental result in the study of sequences and limits.

### Math Example: The Squeeze Theorem

The Squeeze Theorem helps us evaluate limits of functions that are squeezed between two other functions. If:

$$
f(x) \leq g(x) \leq h(x)
$$

and the limits of \(f(x)\) and \(h(x)\) are equal, then the limit of \(g(x)\) is also equal to that value.

### Conclusion

Real analysis is a crucial area of mathematics that builds the groundwork for many more advanced topics. We will explore more in future posts.
