        <p>Number theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics, dating back to ancient civilizations. In this post, we will explore some of the most interesting and complex topics in number theory, including prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and the Riemann hypothesis.</p>

        <h2>Prime Numbers and Their Distribution</h2>
        <p>Prime numbers are the building blocks of the natural numbers. Every integer greater than 1 is either a prime or can be factored into primes. One of the fundamental questions in number theory is how prime numbers are distributed. The <strong>Prime Number Theorem</strong> gives an approximation of the number of primes less than a given number \( n \):</p>
        
        <div class="math-example">
            \[
            \pi(n) \sim \frac{n}{\ln(n)}
            \]
        </div>

        <p>Where \( \pi(n) \) is the prime counting function, and \( \ln(n) \) is the natural logarithm of \( n \). This theorem tells us that the density of primes decreases as numbers get larger, but they still appear infinitely often.</p>

        <h2>Modular Arithmetic</h2>
        <p>Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers, where numbers "wrap around" after reaching a certain value, known as the modulus. It plays a key role in many areas of mathematics, including cryptography. For example, the expression \( a \equiv b \ (\text{mod} \ n) \) means that \( a \) and \( b \) leave the same remainder when divided by \( n \).</p>

        <div class="math-example">
            \[
            17 \equiv 5 \ (\text{mod} \ 12)
            \]
        </div>

        <p>This means that when 17 and 5 are divided by 12, they both leave a remainder of 5. Modular arithmetic is used extensively in cryptographic algorithms like RSA, where large primes are used to ensure security.</p>

        <h2>The Riemann Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>One of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics is the <strong>Riemann Hypothesis</strong>, which concerns the distribution of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function \( \zeta(s) \). The hypothesis suggests that all non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line \( \Re(s) = \frac{1}{2} \), where \( s \) is a complex number.</p>

        <div class="math-example">
            \[
            \zeta(s) = 0 \quad \text{for} \quad \Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}
            \]
        </div>

        <p>The Riemann Hypothesis has profound implications for number theory and the distribution of prime numbers. Despite much effort, this conjecture remains unproven, making it one of the most tantalizing open questions in mathematics.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>These topics represent just a small fraction of the vast and fascinating world of number theory. From the beauty of prime numbers to the deep mysteries of the Riemann zeta function, number theory continues to captivate mathematicians and inspire new research. As we continue exploring these topics, we will uncover even more profound insights into the nature of numbers and their role in the universe.</p>
