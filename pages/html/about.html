        <section class="expandable">
            <h2 class="section-header">About Me</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I am an undergraduate student in Mathematics at Indiana University, with a focus on deepening my understanding in areas such as Abstract Algebra, Algebraic Number Theory, and Algebraic Topology. Alongside my studies, I work as a Mathematics Tutor, helping students navigate various topics and building a strong foundation in mathematical thinking. In the coming years, I am preparing to transition into a role as a homeschool teacher, where I plan to apply my passion for classical education. I believe that classical education, with its emphasis on logic, rhetoric, and the trivium, offers a unique and effective approach to learning, particularly in mathematics.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>I am a mathematics undergraduate, tutor, and enthusiast searching out the best way to gain a mathematics education. While doing this, I discovered AoPS. This blog is dedicated to fleshing out the AoPS books and developing a teaching philosophy around this content. In a section below, I link directly to my AoPS blogs even though all the same content can be found here, and my main mathematics-focused blog can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">My Projects</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>My interest lies in the classical methodology of teaching mathematics, drawing inspiration from historical texts and approaches that prioritize problem-solving, proof-based learning, and a deep understanding of fundamental principles. I aim to create comprehensive reviews of textbooks, resources, and online courses, with the intention of guiding learners toward high-quality materials that align with these classical principles. One of my primary objectives is to develop a set of Classical Education Curricula and Self-Education Guides that cater to a wide audience, from beginners to advanced learners.</p>

        <!-- Learning Pathways Section -->
        <section class="expandable">
            <h2 class="section-header">Learning Pathways</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I am particularly interested in creating learning pathways that integrate not only mathematical content but also the art of learning itself. This includes exploring techniques for improving focus, memory retention, discipline, and time management — all essential skills for mastering mathematics and other disciplines. My goal is to design resources that help learners build a solid foundation in mathematics while also equipping them with lifelong learning skills that extend beyond the classroom.</p>

        <!-- Future Vision Section -->
        <section class="expandable">
            <h2 class="section-header">My Future Vision</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>In the future, I envision curating and developing educational content that provides structured, yet flexible learning experiences. I plan to create guides tailored to various age groups and skill levels, enabling learners to progress at their own pace while mastering core concepts. This holistic approach to education aims to foster a deeper appreciation for mathematics and empower individuals to pursue self-education with confidence and curiosity.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>My long-term vision is to contribute meaningfully to the field of mathematics education by promoting classical approaches and providing accessible, high-quality resources for learners of all ages. Through my work as a tutor, future homeschool teacher, and curriculum developer, I hope to inspire a love for mathematics and support the growth of independent, self-motivated learners.</p>
